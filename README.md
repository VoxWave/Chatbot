# Chatbot
A modular chatbot experiment.

The repository is split into multiple folders.
The `Chatbot` folder contains the code ready for generating a WASM module of our Chatbot application.
The other folders contain different runtime implementations for running the Chatbot.
Each folder contains a README file containing information and instructions for how to compile the runtimes and application.

The `Chatbot/precompiled` folder contains a precompiled version of each runtime and the Chatbot.
